## Open Seat Monitor

Open Seat Monitor is a full-stack web application that monitors classes for open seats and notifies users when a seat is available. The back-end was developed using python and a sqlite3 database while the front-end was developed with HTML/CSS. Using docker, this application was hosted on Google Cloud Run but is no longer up due to free-trial time limit. An email with app passwords enabled is needed for full functionality of sending and receiving emails but basic functionality can be seen by running the application with no email environment variables.
